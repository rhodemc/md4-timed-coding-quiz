## Description

I was motivated to create a timed coding quiz because I feel it is important for beginner coders to quiz themselves on recently learned information.

Using this timed coding quiz allows for quick review of recently learned material. It's a great resource for people with limited study time.

When using this timed coding quiz, you'll find responsive answer buttons, a timer that depletes faster if a question is answered incorrectly and the ability to save your high score.
